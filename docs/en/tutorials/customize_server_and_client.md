# Tutorial 5: Customize Server and Client

COALA abstracts the federated learning (FL) training flow in the server and the client into granular stages, as shown in the image below.

![Training Flow](../_static/image/training-flow.png)

You have the flexibility to customize any stage of the training flow while reusing the rest by implementing a customized server/client.  

## Customize Server

COALA implements random client selection and [Federated Averaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629) as the aggregation strategy. 
You can customize the server implementation by inheriting [BaseServer](../api.html#coala.server.BaseServer) and override specific functions.

Below is an example of a customized server. 
```python
import coala
from coala.server import BaseServer
from coala.server.base import MODEL

class CustomizedServer(BaseServer):
    def __init__(self, conf, **kwargs):
        super(CustomizedServer, self).__init__(conf, **kwargs)
        pass  # more initialization of attributes.
    
    def aggregation(self):
        uploaded_content = self.get_client_uploads()
        models = list(uploaded_content[MODEL].values())
        # Original implementation of aggregation weights
        # weights = list(uploaded_content[DATA_SIZE].values())
        # We can assign the manipulated customized weights in aggregation.   
        customized_weights = list(range(len(models)))
        model = self.aggregate(models, customized_weights)
        self.set_model(model, load_dict=True)

# Register customized server.
coala.register_server(CustomizedServer)
# Initialize federated learning with default configurations.
coala.init()
# Execute federated learning training.
coala.run()
```

Here we list down more useful functions to override to implement a customized server.  

```python
import coala
from coala.server import BaseServer

class CustomizedServer(BaseServer):
    def __init__(self, conf, **kwargs):
        super(CustomizedServer, self).__init__(conf, **kwargs)
        pass  # more initialization of attributes.
    
    def selection(self, clients, clients_per_round):
        pass  # implement customized client selection algorithm.
    
    def compression(self):
        pass  # implement customized compression algorithm.
    
    def pre_train(self):
        pass  # inject operations before distribution to train.
    
    def post_train(self):
        pass  # inject operations after aggregation.
    
    def pre_test(self):
        pass  # inject operations before distribution to test. 
    
    def post_test(self):
        pass  # inject operations after aggregating testing results.
    
    def decompression(self, model):
        pass  # implement customized decompression algorithm.
    
    def aggregation(self):
        pass  # implement customized aggregation algorithm.
```

Below are some attributes that you may need in implementing the customized server.

`self.conf`: Configurations of COALA.

`self._model`: The global model in server, updated after aggregation.

`self._current_round`: The current training round.

`self._clients`: All available clients.

`self.selected_clients`: The selected clients.

You may refer to the [BaseServer](../api.html#coala.server.BaseServer) for more functions and class attributes.

## Customize Client

Each client of COALA conducts training and testing. 
The implementation of training and testing is similar to normal PyTorch implementation.
We implement training with Adam/SGD optimizer using CrossEntropy loss. 
You can customize client implementation of training and testing by inheriting [BaseClient](../api.html#coala.client.BaseClient) and overriding specific functions. 

Below is an example of a customized client. 

```python
import time
import coala
from torch import nn
import torch.optim as optim
from coala.client.base import BaseClient

# Inherit BaseClient to implement customized client operations.
class CustomizedClient(BaseClient):
    def __init__(self, cid, conf, train_data, test_data, device, **kwargs):
        super(CustomizedClient, self).__init__(cid, conf, train_data, test_data, device, **kwargs)
        # Initialize a classifier for each client.
        self.classifier = nn.Sequential(*[nn.Linear(512, 100)])

    def train(self, conf, device):
        start_time = time.time()
        self.model.classifier.classifier = self.classifier.to(device)
        loss_fn, optimizer = self.pretrain_setup(conf, device)
        self.train_loss = []
        for i in range(conf.local_epoch):
            batch_loss = []
            for batched_x, batched_y in self.train_loader:
                x, y = batched_x.to(device), batched_y.to(device)
                optimizer.zero_grad()
                out = self.model(x)
                loss = loss_fn(out, y)
                loss.backward()
                optimizer.step()
                batch_loss.append(loss.item())
            current_epoch_loss = sum(batch_loss) / len(batch_loss)
            self.train_loss.append(float(current_epoch_loss))
        self.train_time = time.time() - start_time
        # Keep the classifier in clients and upload only the backbone of model. 
        self.classifier = self.model.classifier.classifier
        self.model.classifier.classifier = nn.Sequential()        

    # A customized optimizer that sets different learning rates for different model parts.
    def load_optimizer(self, conf):
        ignored_params = list(map(id, self.model.classifier.parameters()))
        base_params = filter(lambda p: id(p) not in ignored_params, self.model.parameters())
        optimizer = optim.SGD([
            {'params': base_params, 'lr': 0.1 * conf.optimizer.lr},
            {'params': self.model.classifier.parameters(), 'lr': conf.optimizer.lr}
        ], weight_decay=5e-4, momentum=conf.optimizer.momentum, nesterov=True)
        return optimizer

# Register customized client.
coala.register_client(CustomizedClient)
# Initialize federated learning with default configurations.
coala.init()
# Execute federated learning training.
coala.run()
```

Here we list down more useful functions to override to implement a customized client.  

```python
import coala
from coala.client import BaseClient

# Inherit BaseClient to implement customized client operations.
class CustomizedClient(BaseClient):
    def __init__(self, cid, conf, train_data, test_data, device, **kwargs):
        super(CustomizedClient, self).__init__(cid, conf, train_data, test_data, device, **kwargs)
        pass  # more initialization of attributes.

    def decompression(self):
        pass  # implement decompression method.

    def pre_train(self):
        pass  # inject operations before training. 

    def train(self, conf, device):
        pass  # implement customized training method.
    
    def post_train(self):
        pass  # inject operations after training.
    
    def load_loss_fn(self, conf):
        pass  # load a customized loss function.
        return loss

    def load_optimizer(self, conf):
        pass  # load a customized optimizer
        return optimizer

    def load_loader(self, conf):
        pass  # load a customized data loader.
        return train_loader

    def test_local(self):
        pass  # implement testing of the trained model before uploading to the server.

    def pre_test(self):
        pass  # inject operations before testing. 

    def test(self, conf, device):
        pass  # implement customized testing.
    
    def post_test(self):
        pass  # inject operations after testing.

    def encryption(self):
        pass  # implement customized encryption method.

    def compression(self):
        pass  # implement customized compression method.

    def upload(self):
        pass  # implement customized upload method.

    def post_upload(self):
        pass  # implement customized post upload method.
```

Below are some attributes that you may need in implementing the customized client.

`self.conf`: Configurations of client, under key "client" of config dictionary.

`self.compressed_model`: The model downloaded from the server.

`self.model`: The model used for training.

`self.cid`: The client id.

`self.device`: The device for training. 

`self.train_data`: The training data of the client.

`self.test_data`: The testing data of the client.

You may refer to the [BaseClient](../api.html#coala.client.BaseClient) for more functions and class attributes.

## Existing Works

We surveyed 33 papers from recent publications of FL from both the machine learning and system community. 
The following table shows that 10 out of 33 (~30%) publications propose new algorithms with changes in only one stage of the training flow, and the majority (~57%) change only two stages. 
Training flow abstraction you to focus on the problems, without re-implementing the whole FL process.
