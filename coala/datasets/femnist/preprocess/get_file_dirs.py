"""
These codes are adopted from LEAF with some modifications.

Creates .pkl files for:
1. list of directories of every image in 'by_class'
2. list of directories of every image in 'by_write'
the hierarchal structure of the data is as follows:
- by_class -> classes -> folders containing images -> images
- by_write -> folders containing writers -> writer -> types of images -> images
the directories written into the files are of the form 'raw_data/...'
